# What Experts Would Teach You To Do Next
## Post-Meeting: Research-Driven Next Steps

**Context:** After client meeting - continuing expert methodology
**Approach:** Research paper methodology (Knuth, Simons, Renaissance, Jane Street)

---

## Expert Principle: Document, Analyze, Iterate

Experts treat every interaction as data. They:
1. **Document** what happened
2. **Analyze** what worked/didn't work
3. **Update** assumptions and hypotheses
4. **Plan** next iteration based on data
5. **Execute** the highest-impact next step

---

## Phase 1: Document Meeting Outcomes (15 minutes)

### Step 1.1: Meeting Debrief Document

**Create:** `MEETING_DEBRIEF_[DATE].md`

**Document:**
- Who attended (client, counsel, SME)
- What was shown/demonstrated
- Questions asked
- Feedback received (positive/negative/neutral)
- Concerns raised
- Commitments made
- Next steps discussed

**Structure (Research Paper Style):**
```markdown
# Meeting Debrief - [Date]

## Attendees
- Client: [Name]
- Lead Counsel: [Name]
- SME: [Name]
- You: [Name]

## Demonstration
- What was shown: [Details]
- Did demo work? [Yes/No/Partially]
- Client reaction: [Observations]

## Feedback Received
### Positive
- [Feedback item]
- [Confidence increased?]

### Concerns
- [Concern item]
- [Risk level]

### Questions
- [Question item]
- [Answer provided]

## Outcomes
- Confidence level: [Before] → [After]
- Key learnings: [What we learned]
- Next steps: [Agreed actions]
```

### Step 1.2: Quantitative Metrics

**Measure:**
- Did confidence increase by 20%? (Yes/No/Partial)
- How much time was spent in meeting? (minutes)
- How many questions were asked? (count)
- What was the sentiment? (scale 1-5)
- Were commitments made? (Yes/No)

**Record these numbers** - Experts measure everything.

---

## Phase 2: Analyze Feedback (30 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Update Assumptions

**Review your assumptions** (from RESEARCH_PAPER_APPROACH.md):
- Which assumptions were validated?
- Which assumptions were proven wrong?
- Which assumptions need revision?

**Document:**
```markdown
## Assumption Validation Results

A1: Wails Works as Expected
- Status: [Validated/Proven Wrong/Unclear]
- Evidence: [What happened]
- Update: [New assumption if needed]

A2: USB Drive is Accessible
- Status: [Validated/Proven Wrong/Unclear]
- Evidence: [What happened]
- Update: [New assumption if needed]
```

### Step 2.2: Revise Hypotheses

**Update your hypotheses** based on meeting feedback:
- Did H1 (Wails Communication) hold?
- What did client care about most?
- What concerns did they raise?
- What would increase their confidence?

**Create new hypotheses** based on feedback:
- H6: Client values [X] more than [Y]
- H7: Showing [X] increases confidence by [Y]%
- H8: [Concern] can be addressed by [Solution]

### Step 2.3: Identify Critical Path

**Answer:** "What single action would reduce uncertainty the most?"

Based on expert principle: **Work on the 1 thing that reduces possible choices the most**

**Questions:**
- What was the biggest concern?
- What would address that concern?
- What's the highest-impact next step?
- What reduces complexity/uncertainty most?

---

## Phase 3: Update Research Questions (15 minutes)

### Step 3.1: Refine Research Questions

**Original RQs** (from RESEARCH_PAPER_APPROACH.md):
- RQ1: Does Wails communication work?
- RQ2: Does data lake connection work?
- RQ3: Is UI flow usable?
- RQ4: Can we expand incrementally?

**New/Revised RQs** based on meeting:
- RQ5: What does client value most? (from feedback)
- RQ6: What increases client confidence? (from feedback)
- RQ7: What addresses client concerns? (from feedback)
- RQ8: What's the critical path to value? (from analysis)

### Step 3.2: Prioritize Research Questions

**Rank by impact:**
1. Highest impact (addresses biggest concern)
2. Second highest impact
3. And so on...

**Focus on #1** - Experts focus on highest-impact work.

---

## Phase 4: Plan Next Iteration (30 minutes)

### Step 4.1: Define Next Work Unit

**Expert Principle:** "Work on the 1 thing that reduces possible choices the most"

**Questions:**
- What single work unit reduces uncertainty most?
- What addresses the biggest client concern?
- What increases confidence the most?
- What's the critical path item?

**Answer should be ONE thing** - not a list, not multiple things, ONE thing.

### Step 4.2: Create Work Unit Specification

**For the next work unit, document:**

1. **Objective:** What are we trying to achieve? (1 sentence)
2. **Why This:** Why this work unit over others? (reduces uncertainty most)
3. **Success Criteria:** How do we know it's done? (measurable)
4. **Assumptions:** What do we assume? (explicit)
5. **Risks:** What could go wrong? (identified)
6. **Time Estimate:** How long? (hours)
7. **Dependencies:** What do we need? (prerequisites)

### Step 4.3: Break Down Work Unit

**If the work unit is > 2 hours, break it down:**
- What are the sub-steps?
- What's the order?
- What can be done in parallel?
- What's the critical path?

**Experts break work into 1-2 hour chunks.**

---

## Phase 5: Execute Next Work Unit (Start Now)

### Step 5.1: Start with the ONE Thing

**Expert Principle:** Focus on ONE thing at a time.

**Do:**
- Start the highest-impact work unit
- Focus only on that
- Complete it before moving on

**Don't:**
- Work on multiple things
- Switch tasks
- Start new things before finishing

### Step 5.2: Measure Progress

**As you work:**
- Time spent (track actual vs. estimate)
- Decisions made (document)
- Issues encountered (document)
- Learnings (document)

**Experts track everything.**

---

## Expert Work Pattern

### The 3-Minute Rule (Your Request)

**Every 3 minutes, ask:**
- "Am I working on the 1 thing that reduces choices the most?"
- "Is this the highest-impact work?"
- "Should I switch to something else?"

**If answer is "no":** Switch to the highest-impact work.

### The Iteration Cycle

1. **Document** (15 min) - What happened?
2. **Analyze** (30 min) - What did we learn?
3. **Plan** (30 min) - What's next?
4. **Execute** (focused work) - Do the ONE thing
5. **Repeat** - Document results, analyze, plan, execute

## Key Expert Principles Applied

1. **Document Everything** - Meeting outcomes are data
2. **Measure Everything** - Quantitative metrics
3. **Update Assumptions** - Based on real feedback
4. **Focus on ONE Thing** - Highest impact work
5. **Iterate Based on Data** - Not assumptions
6. **Reduce Uncertainty** - Work on what reduces choices most

## Your Pattern Recognition Edge

**Remember:** Your 118k → 2 reduction capability is the edge.

**Apply it to work planning:**
- What single work unit reduces the most complexity?
- What reduces the most uncertainty?
- What's the critical path to value?

**Use your pattern recognition to find the ONE thing.**

---

## Next Action

**START WITH:** Document the meeting (15 minutes)

Create `MEETING_DEBRIEF_[DATE].md` and record:
- What happened
- What feedback you received
- What concerns were raised
- What increased/decreased confidence

Then analyze, plan, and execute the ONE highest-impact work unit.

---

**Expert Teaching:** Document → Analyze → Plan → Execute → Repeat

**Your Edge:** Pattern recognition to find the ONE thing that reduces choices most.
