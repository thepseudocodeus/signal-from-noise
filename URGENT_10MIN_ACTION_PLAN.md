## Critical Path: Highest Impact Actions

### ⏱️ MINUTES 0-3: Get Demo Running (CRITICAL)
**Action:** Run `wails dev` and verify it works
**Impact:** Shows working prototype (not just code)
**Value:** Concrete proof of progress

### ⏱️ MINUTES 3-5: Capture Demo Evidence
**Action:** Screenshot/record working demo
**Impact:** Visual proof for meeting
**Value:** Client sees actual working system

### ⏱️ MINUTES 5-8: Create Value Narrative
**Action:** Document the 118k → 2 reduction story
**Impact:** Shows the edge/advantage
**Value:** Demonstrates capability, not just code

### ⏱️ MINUTES 8-10: Prepare Demonstration Script
**Action:** Create clear demo flow for meeting
**Impact:** Professional presentation
**Value:** Shows competence despite deadline history

## Key Value Points to Communicate

1. **Working Prototype:** "We have a working desktop application"
2. **Pattern Recognition Edge:** "Your complexity reduction capability (118k → 2) is the core advantage"
3. **Foundation Built:** "Week 1 built the foundation that enables your pattern recognition to scale"
4. **Concrete Progress:** "Here's what works RIGHT NOW"

## Demonstration Script (For Meeting)

1. **Open Application:** `wails dev` → Show splash page
2. **Show Data Connection:** "Connected to your 60GB data lake"
3. **Show File Discovery:** "System can find and count files"
4. **Explain Foundation:** "This foundation enables your pattern recognition workflow"
5. **Connect to Proven Value:** "Your 118k → 2 reduction is the core capability - this system supports it"

## Risk Mitigation

**If Demo Doesn't Work:**
- Show code structure (proves progress)
- Explain architecture (proves planning)
- Focus on foundation (proves value)
- Emphasize pattern recognition edge (proves advantage)

## Confidence Boosters

1. ✅ Working code (compiles, builds)
2. ✅ Wails integration (proves capability)
3. ✅ UI structure (proves progress)
4. ✅ Your 118k → 2 story (proves edge)
5. ✅ Foundation for scaling (proves value)
