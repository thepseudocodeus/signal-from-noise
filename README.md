## About

This is the official Wails React template.

You can configure the project by editing `wails.json`. More information about the project settings can be found
here: <https://wails.io/docs/reference/project-config>

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on <http://localhost:34115>. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.

Discoveries

1.1. Edge is the 118k → 2 reduction. Week 1 built the foundation. This system enables scaling. Lead with your proven capability, then show the foundation that supports it.

1.2. Job is reducing problem complexity to a set of subproblems where counting can be used to measure progress towards the solution and the question is: is this element a member of the invariant set in the invariant set of parts of this discrete problem.
