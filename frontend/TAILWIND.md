# Tailwind Design Document

## Goal

May the tedious process of search through 117,000+ documents that occupies 50+ GB of space enjoyable.

## Problem

Structuring unstructured data is a complex problem. After research them for a decade, I believe Jim Simons, Robert Mercer, and Renaissance Technologies have discovered the optimal strategy and tactics to do this better than anyone. Further, their advantage appears antifragile because they have build this edge into a real-time, dynamic, adaptive system that emergently has hive intelligent from potentially millions of granular, independent systems focused on mapping one set of inputs to one set of outputs using one set of processes.

## Hypothesis

If I everyday going forward aim to:

1. Solve one problem daily
2. Treat achieving this objective as writing a research paper at the quality demanded by Jim Simons, Robert Mercer, and Renaissance Technologies and as clearly, concisely, precisely, methodically, mathematically, scientifically, etc as they would teach me is necessary to achieve what they have achieved
3. But communicate (written, oral, visual, etc) in a manner optimized to use neuroscience and behaviorial psychology how Terrence Tao, the writers of Freakonomics, the top 1% of editors for Economist, and the writers of Made To Stick
